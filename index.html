            preconceptions, whether they’re about bikinis or President
            Jair Bolsonaro, is just about impossible. But Rio constantly
            finds ways to surprise — whether it’s a friendly resident
            walking you to a shop you just can’t find; sobering evidence
            of the city’s slave trade; or the discovery that food tastes
            best standing on a sidewalk surrounded by the lyrical sound
            of Portuguese and accompanied by a beer so cold it’ll make
            your fillings hurt. From beach to museum, church to market,
            Rio is a city constantly defying its own myths and encourages
            visitors to join in with unbridled enthusiasm.</p>

          <p class="friday1p hide">Brazilian cuisine leans heavily on meat and seafood, so
            it’s a pleasure to find vegetarian food that’s neither fried
            nor boring. Naturalie is open only for lunch, and its menu
            (much of it vegan and gluten-free) makes good use of local
            produce like manioc and coconut. Salads come with a bright
            pink beet dressing; there’s a rich stew known as feijoada
            that replaces meat with tofu; and fresh juices are crammed
            with passion fruit, hibiscus and goji berries, and — unlike
            their lunch-counter counterparts — they aren’t full of added
            sugar. It’s carefully considered, unfussy dining that just
            happens to be vegetarian. Lunch for two, around 100 reais,
            or about $26.</p>

            Ipanema and Copacabana, which also have the best beaches:
            stretches of pristine sand bordering gentle waves. Pick up
            a bathing suit at Blue Man, a decades-old Brazilian brand of
            swimwear that produces eye-catching bikinis, one-pieces and
            briefs in colorful parrot and pineapple patterns (prices
            start around 150 reais). Swing by Osklen, another well-known
            Brazilian brand, which sells elegant T-shirts in linen and
            silk. They recently developed a line of clothing printed with
            images from the work of the pioneering Brazilian artist
            Tarsila do Amaral (an exhibition of her work was at the
            Museum of Modern Art in New York City last year). At Monica
            Pondé, just around the corner, pick up brushed silver
            necklaces with geometric flair (Ms. Mondé, the designer,
            studied architecture), and grab a petit noir coffee from the
            adjacent cafe: the beans are collected from the droppings of
            the jacu, a native bird that ingests only the very ripest
            beans, and the resulting coffee is rich and full-bodied.
            Make a final stop at Toca do Vinicius, a shop for music
            lovers, where all the vintage records and newly released
            CDs are bossa nova and samba.</p>

          <p class="hide friday3p">Pavão Azul (blue peacock) is an excellent spot to kick
            off an evening. Packed with an after-work crowd vying for
            seats or standing around small tables, this place is famous
            for its pataniscas: fried balls with chunks of cod and
            slivers of onion, and served with extra-cold beer. If you’re
            feeling brave, try the vodka-coconut mix poured out of a
            Smirnoff bottle — it’s made in-house and is equal parts
            delicious and potent. Then stroll north to Galeto Sat’s,
            a casual spot with just a dozen tables and, behind the bar,
            rows of spring chickens roasting on giant skewers over the
            flames. Start with a basket of the famous garlic bread,
            buttery and liberally doused with garlic bits, add a plate
            of juicy, bite-sized chicken hearts, then round off the meal
            with the roast chicken. Dinner for two, around 120 reais.</p>

            it’s the kind of local bar that seems to be actively
            discouraging new customers. The only seats are occupied
            by the musicians and regulars, and the beer — a selection
            of mediocre Brazilian brands and cans of Heineken — is in a
            refrigerator in the back from which you have to help
            yourself. The music, though, is worth twice as much hassle:
            Expect to find a group of eight or so playing and singing
            samba and bossa nova with passion. That passion is shared
            by the onlookers, who dance, sing along (quietly) and snap
            their fingers in applause. The longtime owner, known to
            all as Alfredinho, passed away a few weeks ago, but the
            music plays on.</p>

            (admission, 20 reais) opened with great fanfare in 2015.
            Inside, the exhibits are mostly virtual — hundreds of
            towering screens, some with interactive games, and an
            IMAX-style film — but the content itself focuses more on
            the nature of community, sustainability and disaster-
            forecasting than on futuristic imaginings. The exterior
            and the grounds of the museum are, perhaps, even more
            impressive. Stroll around the water features, admire the
            audacious architecture (it’s been compared to everything
            from a spaceship to a crocodile), and then head to the
            Museu de Arte do Rio (admission 20 reais) across the plaza.
            This dynamic museum has a frequently changing collection
            of work by mostly Brazilian artists. Make sure to visit the
            roof, from which you can see, across the way, a portrait
            blasted in stone on the side of a neighboring building by

            is an integral yet understudied part of the country’s
            heritage. Spend a few hours exploring its legacy, starting
            with lunch at Angu do Gomes. This restaurant first opened
            in 1955, serving angu, a hearty polenta and meat stew with
            African roots (lunch for two, around 150 reais). From here,
            walk to Valongo Wharf, a Unesco Heritage Site, which was
            the arrival point for almost a million slaves, most from
            West and Central Africa. The wharf itself had been covered
            over and was only rediscovered amid preparations for the
            2016 Olympics. Not far from here is Praça XV. There’s not
            much to be seen now in this huge space except a boat-
            ticketing office and some skateboarders, but it was once
            the site of massive slave auctions. The Instituto de
            Pesquisa e Memória Pretos Novos (open 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.,
            free admission), is a small but sobering museum about the
            slave trade built atop a cemetery — you can still see bones
            exposed in the ground.</p>

            cars to the top of Pão de Açúcar, head to the mountain’s
            base instead. The Claudio Coutinho trail is bordered with
            steep slopes and trees populated with families of capuchin
            monkeys on one side, and waves crashing against enormous
            rocks on the other. After you’ve broken a sweat, stroll
            in the other direction around the peninsula (or take a short
            taxi ride) to Bar Urca, a longtime neighborhood landmark
            dishing out crispy pastries stuffed with meat, bobó de
            camarão (a creamy shrimp dish), icy beers and fried balls
            of bacalao (snacks and beer for two, around 130 reais).

            foam with the texture of heavy cream — are some of the
            cleverest cocktails in town. Dinner is at Oro, which got
            its second Michelin star in 2018. Felipe Bronze, the chef,
            has created tasting menus of modern Brazilian dishes that
            recently included granulated tapioca with shrimp and

            A 10-minute walk south is Arpoador Beach, where you’ll
            often see surfers floating on the water like sea gulls
            waiting to catch the perfect wave. If you’re here around
            sunset, join the groups climbing the rocks at the eastern
            end of the beach for the best views.</p>

          <p class="lodgingp">There are plenty of Airbnb options in Rio; a one-bedroom is
            often available for less than $50 a night (depending on the
            season). Botafogo and Flamengo are central neighborhoods positioned
            between the southern beaches and the cultural offerings of the
            northern section of the city.</p>
          <p class="lodgingp">The clean, spare Praia Ipanema (doubles start around 490 reais,
            including breakfast) is as close as Rio hotels get to the beach,
            which is just across the road. All rooms have balconies and superior
            rooms have ocean views. The hotel has a beach stand with free chairs
            and towels.</p>
          <p class="lodgingp">Halfway between the port area and the South Zone, the funky,
            Philippe Starck-designed Yoo2 (doubles start at 270 reais, including
            breakfast) has a prime location for city exploration. The small
            rooftop pool has great views of the Christ the Redeemer statue in
            one direction and Botafogo beach in the other.</p>
